Masternode requirements
=======================

- 5000 Historia: An IPFS masternode requires 5000 HTA. Historia can be obtained from exchanges such as Stex. This role gives voting rights to the masternode owner and receives a 25% reward. IPFS daemon is required to provide for content distribution.
- A server or VPS running Linux: Most recent guides use Ubuntu 18.04
  LTS. We recommend VPS services such as Vultr and DigitalOcean,
  although any decent provider will do. Generally, an instance with low
  to average specifications will do, although performance requirements
  will increase according to this roadmap.
- A dedicated IPv4: These usually come with the VPS/server.
- A little time and (heart): Masternodes used to require complex setup,
  but tools such as historiaman now greatly simplify the process.

In addition to the 5000 Historia held in collateral, masternodes also have
minimum hardware requirements. As of version v0.17.0.0, these requirements
are as follows:

+---------+------------+-------------+
|         | Minimum    | Recommended |
+=========+============+=============+
| CPU     | 1x 1 GHz   | 1x 2 GHz    |
+---------+------------+-------------+
| RAM     | 2 GB       | 4 GB        |
+---------+------------+-------------+
| Disk    | 20 GB      | 40 GB       |
+---------+------------+-------------+
| Network | 400 GB/mth | 1 TB/mth    |
+---------+------------+-------------+

Masternode bandwidth use ranges between 30-100 GB per month and will
grow as the network does.
